          Hi, my name is Leon Leakono. I'm a boy turning 10, and I like to learn new things like programming
          when I see someone talking about it. My siblings are Kailin, my big sister who is turning 13 this year, 
          and my big brother Leslie Leakono who is turning 16 â€” sometimes he's a little difficult!
          <br /><br />
          My mom is called Felister Leakono and she is turning 37, and my dad is called Sanico Leakono.
          I also have a big cousin named Emmanuel Leakono who is turning 21, and an aunt named Joyce who is turning 22.
